# WAHighlakes
A visualization of Washington State Highlake fish stocking information in python and Power BI

This tool was created to find potential backcountry fishing locations in Washington's Cascade range. 
Data is from the WDFW site; However, this project aims to remedy their sites poor navigability and lack of interactive tools 
making it difficult to find good fishing locations.
This is accomplished with a geospacial analysis of lakes with the ability to filter and sort lakes based on fish species, 
stocking date, stocked volume, lake elevation, lake size, and distance from my home.
Source CSV files are provided, but can be refreshed by running the provided python files to re-scrape the data from the WDFW sites.
